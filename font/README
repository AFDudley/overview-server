To edit our font:

1. Edit SVG files in svg/. All icons should have:
  * em box: 512px * 512px. (Make the width thinner if the font is thinner;
    never modify the height.
  * descender: 64px. (With a 32px * 32px grid, you should usually leave two
    grid squares at the bottom of the icon, to match up with fonts' baselines.)
  * mean height: 352 px. (With a 32px * 32px grid, you should usually leave
    three grid squares from the top of the icon.)
2. Follow the instructions at http://fontcustom.com/#installation to install
   Font Custom.
3. In this directory, run `fontcustom compile svg`
4. `cp font/overview-project-icons.* ../public/fonts/`
5. Edit `font/fontcustom-bootstrap.css` to add a base path to the fonts. For
   instance, `overview-project-icons.eot` should become
   `../fonts/overview-project-icons.eot`.overview-project-icons.eot` should become
   `../fonts/overview-project-icons.eot`.overview-project-icons.eot` should become
   `../fonts/overview-project-icons.eot`.overview-project-icons.eot` should become
   `../fonts/overview-project-icons.eot`.overview-project-icons.eot` should become
   `../fonts/overview-project-icons.eot`.
4. `cp font/fontcustom-bootstrap.css ../app/assets/stylesheets/icons.less`
