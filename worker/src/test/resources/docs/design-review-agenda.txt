ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

F. ADJOURNMENT To the regular Design Review Committee meeting on Wednesday, April 27, 2011 at 3:30 p.m. in the Council Chamber. G. NOTICES 1. The Design Review Committee's authority includes approval of applications as submitted or approval of applications subject to conditions or modifications that are acceptable to the applicant. The Design Review Committee may recommend to the Planning Commission denial of applications or approval of applications subject to conditions or modifications not acceptable to the applicant. 2. Since the action of the Design Review Committee (DRC) has some amount of discretion it is subject to environmental review under CEQA. However, because the review by the DRC is limited only to the aesthetics of the project, the DRC has no authority to shape the project in any way to mitigate for physical

environmental damage and therefore the project is exempt from environmental review under CEQA Guidelines ?15061.

The meeting room is ADA accessible. Accommodations and access to City meetings for people with special needs must be requested of the City Clerk at 441-4175 72 hours in advance of the meeting.
